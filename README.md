# MyReads Project

React application that allow you to search for new books and classify them into three status: currently reading, want to read, and read. 

The home page shows the books you have selected to be in your "shelf". Click on the the green button on each book to change the status. Option "None" removes the book from your "shelf".

To search for new books click on the "+" button in the home page's lower right corner. To add a book to your "shelf", the process is the same as to change the book status on the home page: Click on the the green button on each book to change the status.

This project has a package json file with all the dependencies needeed to run the code! It really simplifies everything. Basically you have three steps before you can run it on your computer:

Step 1 - Check to see if you have node.js installed on your machine. If you don't, go ahead and install node.js.

Step 2 - Node.js comes with Node Package Manager. God bless whoever created this thing. After downloading it, go to this application's root directory and run the command "npm install". This command install all dependencies.

Step 3 - Once you dependencies are installe, run the command "npm start". Your default browser should run the application after you take these 3 steps.
